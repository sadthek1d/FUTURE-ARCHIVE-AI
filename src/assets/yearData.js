The Perceptron was designed to recognize patterns and  classify input data, such as distinguishing between different shapes. Rosenblatt’s work on Perceptrons laid the groundwork for neural networks, which would become a fundamental component of AI research, especially in the areas of pattern recognition and machine learning.'

      text: ' In 1958, John McCarthy, one of the founders of AI, developed the LISP (LISt Processing) programming language. LISP became the primary language for AI research due to its flexibility and ability to process symbolic information. LISP’s introduction marked a significant milestone in AI, providing researchers with a powerful tool to develop and test AI algorithms, and it remains influential in the field to this day.'

      title: '1959: The Formation of AI Research Labs',
      text: 'By 1959, the establishment of dedicated AI research laboratories marked the growing recognition of AI  as a distinct scientific discipline. Institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford University emerged as early centers  of AI research, attracting leading experts and fostering innovation. The creation of these labs signaled the start of a more structured and formalized approach to AI research and development.'
